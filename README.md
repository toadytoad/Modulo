# Modulo
ICS4 Culminating Assignment
Luke Mathieu, Tom Philip, Ethan Xu

## Game Instructions
Control the player using the WASD keys. Walk into objects to interact with them. To close a popup on the screen, move in any direction.

In the Learning level, travel around the world, entering all of the schools, and interacting with all of the teachers to receive math lessons.
A secondary learning level containing more schools is located directly southeast of the main level. To proceed on to the Maze level, travel north
from the secondary learning level.

In the Maze level, upon entering the area outlined by the coordinate axes, a popup containing two equations with two variables (x and y) will be
displayed. The solution to the equations indicates the coordinates of the next tile you should stand on. Alternatively, the coordinates of the next
tile are printed to the console, if the application is run through a terminal. Stand on the next tile until the tiles around the tile ignite into flame,
at which point the next two equations will be provided, which indicate the next tile in the path. Repeat until the end of the maze is reached, and travel
north to continue into the escape room level.

The escape room level contains 4 pieces of paper on the ground. Each piece of paper has a linear equation with a single variable. The solutions to the linear
equations correnspond to digits of the combination lock. Enter the correct combination into the combination lock to pass, and travel north to complete the game.

## Installation/Running the Program

1. Ensure that Java 17 is installed.
2. Extract all files from the Modulo.zip file
3. Verify that the .jar file is located in the same directory as a folder named "assets", and that the assets folder contains PNG files and subdirectories.
4. Run the program, either by double-clicking the .jar file or running it from the console using "java -jar Modulo-1.0-all.jar".
